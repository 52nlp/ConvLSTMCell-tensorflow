# ConvLSTMCell-tensorflow
Convolutional LSTM network cell (ConvLSTM).
The implementation is based on (http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04214) and BasicLSTMCell in TensorFlow. (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn_cell.py)
 
Future : Peephole connection will be added as the full LSTMCell implementation of TensorFlow.
